        <p>You can use this service to contact the Building Safety Regulator (BSR) about a building from when it is being designed or constructed as well as when it is in use and occupied.</p>
        <p>BSR regulates specific risks to building safety:</p>
        <!--
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>structural failure</li>
          <li>spread of fire</li>
          <li><mark>anymore required?</mark></li>
        </ul>
        -->
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who should use this service and why</h2>

        <p>Use this service to get advice from BSR, and to raise a complaint or file a mandatory occurrence report (MOR) with BSR if you are:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>an accountable person or principle accountable person</li>
          <li>building inspector</li>
          <li>building control approver</li>
          <li>principle client, contractor or designer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are an AP or PAP, you must file a MOR for a building in the event of a risk of structural failure or spread of fire.</p>
        
        <p>Only APs and PAPs can file a MOR.</p>
        
        <p>If you are another accountable or responsible person for a building, and you consider a MOR should have been filed but has not, you can make a complaint using this service.</p>
        
        <p>Members of the public, such as residents of a building, can also use this service to make a complaint about a building with BSR. If you’re a member of the public, first make your complaint to an accountable person for the building, for example, the building’s landlord or management company.</p>
        
        <p>BSR regulates specific risks to building safety:</p>
        
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>structural failure</li>
          <li>spread of fire</li>
          <li><mark>more?</mark></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You should use this service only to complain about these issues, and only if the accountable person you reported them to has not dealt with them.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When not to use this service</h2>

        <p>Do not use this service to report concerns about the general maintenance of a building, for example, malfunctioning lifts, broken windows or doors, external decor, or cleanliness of common parts. Report these issues to an accountable person, such as the building’s landlord or management company.</p>

        <p>If you are unhappy with the behaviour of building contractors during the construction of a building, raise your complaint with the principle contractor.</p>
