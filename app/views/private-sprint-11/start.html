      <p>Use this service to submit both a mandatory occurrence notice and a mandatory occurrence report to the Building Safety Regulator (BSR).</p>

      <p>Read detailed guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-a-mandatory-occurrence"> when you must submit a mandatory notice and report.</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>You must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report for every:</li>
        <li>incident that has happened which risks death or serious injury to a significant number of people </li>
        <li>incident or situation which risks death or serious injury to a significant number of people, if it is not remedied and the building continues to be used </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mandatory occurrences must always be reported, even if the incident or situation is remedied immediately.</p>

      <p>Read detailed guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-a-mandatory-occurrence#what-must-be-reported-to-bsr"> when you must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report.</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who must submit a mandatory notice and report</h2>

      <p>Submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report if you are:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an accountable person or principal accountable person and the building is occupied</li>
        <li>principal contractor or principal designer and construction work has started on the building</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Accountable person and principal accountable person</h2>

      <p>If you are an accountable person or principal accountable person, or acting on behalf of one, you must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report if something causes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>structural failure</li>
        <li>spread of fire</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You must also submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report if an incident or situation that if not remedied risks causing:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>structural failure</li>
        <li>spread of fire</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Principal contractor and principal designer</h3>

      <p>If you are a principal contractor or principal designer, or acting on behalf of one, you must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report if something:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>causes structural failure</li>
        <li>diminishes fire safety</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You must also submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report if something risks causing:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>structural failure</li>
        <li>diminishing fire safety</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You do not need to submit a mandatory occurrence notice or report for a building in design until you have a building control application number and construction work has started.</p>

      <p>If the building is partially occupied and partially in design or under construction, then the mandatory notice and report should be submitted by whoever is accountable for the part of the building where the incident or risk occurs.</p>

      <p>For example, if an incident occurs or a risk is identified in the part of the building under construction, then the principal contractor should submit a mandatory notice and report. If an incident occurs or a risk is identified in the occupied part, then the principal accountable person or accountable person should submit a mandatory notice and report.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Who must report during building work on occupied buildings</h3>

      <p>If people are living in the building when building work is being carried out, who must report mandatory occurrences can vary depending on the situation.</p>

      <p>If an incident or risk is discovered that relates to the design plans or the building work, then the principal contractor and principal designer have a duty to ensure a report is made once building work has started.</p>

      <p>In some situations, both the principal designer and the principal contractor will have a duty to make the report.</p>

      <p>If after the work is complete the accountable person becomes aware of an incident or risk that impacts the safety of the residents, then the relevant accountable person must make the report.</p>

      <p>Read detailed guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-a-mandatory-occurrence#what-must-be-reported-to-bsr"> who must submit a mandatory occurrence notice and report</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Mandatory occurrence notice</h2>

      <p>You must submit a mandatory occurrence notice to the Building Safety Regulator as soon as you can when a safety occurrence is identified and before you submit your report.</p>

      <p>To submit a mandatory occurrence notice, we will ask you:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your contact details</li>
        <li>the address of the building where the safety occurrence has been identified</li>
        <li>the date the safety occurrence was identified</li>
        <li>to describe briefly the single incident or risk</li>
        <li>to tell us any immediate actions you’ve taken since to keep people safe</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When you submit a mandatory occurrence notice, we will give you a reference number you can use to submit a mandatory occurrence report.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Mandatory occurrence report</h2>

      <p>You must submit a mandatory occurrence report to the Building Safety Regulator after submitting your notice and within 10 calendar days of identifying the safety occurrence.</p>

      <p>To submit a mandatory occurrence report, we will ask you:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your mandatory occurrence notice reference number</li>
        <li>the building registration number or address if the building is occupied</li>
        <li>the building control application number if the building is in design or construction and construction work has started</li>
        <li>your contact details, the name of your organisation and their involvement in the building</li>
        <li>the type of safety occurrence you are reporting and when and how you became aware of it</li>
        <li>what happened, or is at risk of happening</li>
        <li>who is involved and the effect on them</li>
        <li>what you have done and plan to do to keep people safe</li>
        <li>for any supporting information, such as documents, videos or photos</li>
