        <p>If you are an accountable person (AP), principal accountable person (PAP), principal contractor or principal designer, you must make a mandatory occurrence report (MOR) for a building in the event of a safety occurrence which risks structural failure or spread of fire.</p>
        <p>You commit a criminal offence if you do not make a MOR within 10 days of becoming aware of an occurrence.</p>
        <p>If you are another accountable or responsible person for a building, and you consider a MOR should have been made but has not, use the back function and select “I want to make a complaint about a building”.</p>
