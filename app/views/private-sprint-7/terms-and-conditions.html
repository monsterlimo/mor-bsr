      <p>On these pages you will find details of our <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/privacy.htm" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">Privacy and Data Protection Act Policy</a> which explains how we treat any information you give to us and how we protect your privacy.</p>
      
      <p>You can <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/disclaimer.htm" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">read our Disclaimer</a> which relates to content on websites we may link to, but do not operate.</p>
      
      <p>You can also <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/copyright.htm" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">view our Copyright</a> statement which relates to information on our website and our policy on reproducing any of that information.</p>
      
      <p>You can find details of our <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/privacy-cookies.htm" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">Cookie Policy</a> including how to control and delete cookies.</p>
      
      <p>There may be legal notices elsewhere on this site that relate to how you use the site. We are not liable if we fail to comply with these terms and conditions because of circumstances beyond our reasonable control. We may decide not to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these terms and conditions. We reserve the right to decide to exercise or enforce that right at a later date. Doing so does not mean that we automatically waive the right on any other occasion. If any of these terms and conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining terms and conditions will still apply.</p>
      
      <p>Please check our terms and conditions regularly. We can update them at any time without notice. You will agree to any changes if you continue to use this site after the terms and conditions have been updated.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Services and transactions</h2>
      
      <p>You can use this site to access online HSE services and transactions. Some of these services have their own terms and conditions which also apply and you must read them before you use the service.</p>
      
      <p>You will be asked to provide some personal information in order to register on the website and take advantage of the additional features that registered users can access. This information will be restricted to details which may help us provide better services to you through the website. Our basic registration process will ask for your name, company details and address, telephone contact number and e-mail address. By providing this information you consent to HSE using these details to help provide you with services or answers to queries, as appropriate.</p>
      
      <p>You will be required to agree to HSE using your details in this way when you complete the registration process. Similarly, if you wish to contact HSE through the website you may be asked to provide some limited personal information to enable us to respond to your question or comment. Complaints may be submitted without providing personal details - we will not, however, be able to respond to you unless you provide a means of contact. You do not need to provide us with personal information simply to browse the site. Once you have registered and created an account, it is your responsibility to ensure that login credentials, including passwords, are protected and secure.</p>
      
      <p>If you use the online payment facilities offered on this website, the details you provide will be stored on a secure server operated by the HSE online banking partner (Worldpay). HSE does not have access to these details and we will only hold the information about the identity of the person or business making payment and the nature of the payment.</p>
      
      <p>We store data collected via this site on secure servers and we have strict controls over how and why your data can be accessed. By submitting your data, you agree to this.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Privacy statement</h2>
      
      <p>For most purposes, HSE will only process your information with your consent. In most cases, we will presume that by providing us with details and information in order to obtain a service from HSE, you are consenting to us using those details in order to provide that service to you. Except as set out in this privacy statement, we will not use your personal details for any other purpose without first obtaining your consent to that other purpose or purposes (you may be asked to provide this additional consent at the time you originally contact us, for example in an additional section on a licensing application). The HSE does not sell personal details to any external organisations.</p>
      
      <p>The main exception to the rule that we will not use your details for other purposes relates to our regulatory obligations and the prevention or investigation of a crime or fraud. HSE's functions are set out in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and we are also under a legal obligation to protect public funds. In order to carry out our functions we will sometimes need to share information with other government departments, public authorities, law enforcement agencies, emergency services and organisations acting on our behalf. In all cases we reserve the right to check the information you have provided for accuracy, in order to detect fraud and error. This may involve data matching where we compare different sets of data which we hold for unusual matches or discrepancies; this may also include matching HSE data with external data sources such as information held by other public bodies, Companies House or credit reference agencies. We will also use the information you provide to make sure all amounts we are owed are paid on time. In relation to outstanding money owed, we may also share your information with Debt Management Partners and the Courts. We may also share your information for the same purposes with other public organisations, and with the Police.</p>
      
      <p>By law we are obliged to provide information to certain other public bodies such as the Department for Work and Pensions, courts, tribunals, hearings and other formal bodies dealing with legal processes, and various external regulatory bodies. We also have an obligation to assist in the prevention of crime and we will therefore generally supply specific information which we are asked to provide to the police or other crime detection agencies, provided we are satisfied that the request is connected to an investigation and that disclosure would be lawful and proportionate.</p>
      
      <p>External contractors are occasionally appointed to process information on behalf of HSE and under its instructions. All contractors which do this are appointed under written contracts requiring them to keep the personal information safe and prohibiting them from doing anything with the personal data they process for us other than following HSE instructions.</p>
      
      <p>The HSE carries out data and statistical analyses of the information which we hold in order to undertake our regulatory duties, monitor our performance in various areas and in order to improve service delivery. This data, information and statistics, once they cannot identify any individuals, may be published or shared with other organisations or individuals. HSE also conducts research and assists other bodies to conduct research using the information we hold. We may also share your information with other public bodies under specific data sharing agreements or under agreed Memorandum of Understandings.</p>
      
      <p>If an individual elects to make public statements relating to the HSE and the HSE holds information showing that these statements are incorrect, we may publicise the fact that we hold information contradicting that version. We may also seek your consent to publish the contradictory information; if you decline to give us this consent, we may make your refusal of this consent public.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      
      <p>HSE undertakes significant amounts of research internally where we analyse the data we hold in order to undertake our duties (both now and in the future), measure our performance and provide insights that will allow us to have a positive impact on health and safety, including supporting other organisations in this goal, both in Great Britain and beyond.</p>
      
      <p>We may also allow external organisations and academic researchers access to information to allow them to undertake research. We may also enter into commercial agreements to undertake research or analytics. In each case we carefully assess the request to access our data and assess the request against our Information Use and Privacy Policy. If access is granted we ensure that agreements are put in place with the researchers covering security and use of the information, and we only pass the minimum information to allow the research to be carried out. This generally means we will not disclose personal identifiers such as name or address, but in many cases there is still sufficient information to create the possibility that someone could be identified from the data released. We therefore approach the release of this information as though the information contained personal identifiers and put safeguards around the disclosure appropriate to the release of personal data.</p>
      
      <p>Some of the research we undertake or are involved in requires active participation. In these cases those involved in the research will have been contacted directly to seek their consent both to involvement in the research and to the exchanges of information associated with the research. However much research is population-based and seeking consent would fatally undermine the research methodology. In these cases we do not seek consent. Where possible an express reference to research will be included in communications issued by HSE to those affected and in some cases, it may be possible to opt out of research of this type. If so, the details of how to opt out will be included any communications.</p>
