      <p>The Register a high-rise building service (or register-high-rise-building.hse.gov.uk) is provided by the <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety Executive (HSE)</a> as the Building Safety Regulator.</p>
      
      <p>HSE is the data controller for pages starting with register-high-rise-building.hse.gov.uk.</p>
      
      <p>If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:</p>
      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be the data controller</li>
        <li>be responsible for processing any data you share with them</li>
        <li>publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This privacy notice tells you what you can expect us to do with your personal information when use this service or have an interaction with us as the Building Safety Regulator.</p>
      
      <p>A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.</p>
          
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h2>

      <p>The personal data we collect from you includes:</p>
          
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact us</li>
        <li>your postcode and address</li>
        <li>how you use our emails - for example whether you open them and which links you click on</li>
        <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">web browser</a> you used</li>
        <li>information on how you use the site, <a href="https://register-high-rise-building.hse.gov.uk/help/cookies" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">using cookies</a> and page tagging techniques</li>
      </ul>
              
      <p>Where you provide your consent, we use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">Google Analytics</a> cookies and a Real User Monitoring (RUM) cookie from <a href="https://www.speedcurve.com/features/performance-monitoring/" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">SpeedCurve</a> to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. This includes IP addresses.</p>
              
      <p>Google Analytics processes information about:</p>
              
              
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li>what you click on while you're visiting the site</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We make sure you cannot be directly identified by Google Analytics data. We do this by using <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052" tabindex="0" role="link" class="govuk-link">Google Analytics' IP address anonymisation</a> feature and by removing any other personal data from the titles or URLs of the pages you visit.</p>
      
      <p>We will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would directly identify who you are</p>
      
      <p>SpeedCurve RUM software processes anonymised information about:</p>
                
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how well the pages performed on your device</li>
        <li>performance bottlenecks your device experienced</li>
